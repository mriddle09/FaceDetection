#Face Detection
This project detects faces images in an image taken with the webcam. A box is drawn around each face detected and each individual 
face is displayed at the bottom of the window. 

## Technologies
This project uses the OpenCV library with a java wrapper using cascade classifiers
with an included face detection model.
